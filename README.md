# GridMethod

Tool that sets a grid overlay on top of an uploaded image

This webpage allows you to upload any given picture, choose among the different levels of grids to overlay it with, and to download a copy of the "grid-ed" picture.

v 2.0 -

- reduced line thickness from 5 to 1
- separated "square" grids from diamond grids (though they're still proportional to the image dimensions)
- added 3 extra levels of grids, labeled by the amount of "squares" they draw on width and height
- slight modification of the GUI
